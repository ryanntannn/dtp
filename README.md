# Multilinear Regression Analysis on Energy Efficenct Building Geometries

## About the dataset:

source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/eergy-efficiency-dataset/data

This dataset contains 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We perform a multilinear regression analysis on the dataset to predict the heating and cooling loads of the buildings.
